Answer the following questions.

First, without external resources. Challenge yourself to answer from memory.

Then, research the question to expand on your answer. Even if you feel you have answered the question completely on your own, there is always something more to learn. Write your researched answer in your OWN WORDS.

1. What is object-oriented programming? How is it different than functional programming?

Your answer:

Researched answer: Object-oriented programming is a programming paradigm that uses objects to represent real-world entities and their interactions, while functional programming treats computation as the evaluation of mathematical functions and avoids changing state and mutable data. 

1. What is the difference between a Float and an Integer in Ruby?

Your answer: A Float in Ruby represents numbers with decimal or fractional parts, while an Integer represents whole numbers without any decimals.

Researched answer: Ruby, a Float is a data type that represents approximate decimal numbers with fractional parts, adhering to the IEEE 754 floating-point standard, while an Integer represents exact whole numbers without any decimals

1. Ruby has an implicit return. What does that mean?

Your answer: In Ruby, implicit return refers to the behavior where the result of the last executed expression in a method or block is automatically returned as the return value of that method or block, without explicitly using the return keyword.

Researched answer: In Ruby, implicit return means that the result of the last evaluated expression in a method or block is automatically returned as the method or block's return value, without using the return keyword.

1. How do you extract a value in a Ruby hash?

Your answer: You can extract a value from a hash by using the key associated with that value

Researched answer: In Ruby, you can extract a value from a hash using square brackets [key] notation or the fetch method. Both methods allow you to access the value associated with a specific key in a hash, with the fetch method providing additional options for handling missing keys or setting default values.

1. RSpec: RSpec is a popular testing framework for Ruby that provides a domain-specific language for writing tests in a readable and expressive manner.

2. Test-driven development: Test-driven development is a software development approach where tests are written before the actual code implementation

3. PostgreSQL: PostgreSQL, often referred to simply as "Postgres," is a powerful and open-source object-relational database management system.

4. CRUD: CRUD is an acronym that stands for Create, Read, Update, and Delete. It represents the four fundamental operations that can be performed on data in a database or any other data storage system.
